# Transparent-and-Traceable-Food-Supply-Chain-Management
This repository contains the proposed solution to track the complete path of a product in the food supply chain, providing improved quality assessment, transparency, traceability, and fraud detection capabilities. The project was developed as part of a course on blockchain technology.


## Motivation
The Indian agricultural sector faces various challenges, including fragmented supply chains, inadequate cold chain infrastructure, poor packaging, inefficient traders, and a lack of organized logistics, resulting in inefficiencies and losses. These challenges, along with the absence of technology and a manual labor system, lead to an increase in lead time and costs for importing goods. Furthermore, the lack of compliance and traceability in traditional buying routes causes a growing lack of trust in the sourcing of produce sold in markets. This project's motivation is to explore the potential of blockchain technology in the agricultural sector to improve traceability, sustainability, and transparency while streamlining cooperative operations, benefiting both farmers and consumers.
