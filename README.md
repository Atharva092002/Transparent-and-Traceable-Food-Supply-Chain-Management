# Transparent-and-Traceable-Food-Supply-Chain-Management
This repository contains the proposed solution to track the complete path of a product in the food supply chain, providing improved quality assessment, transparency, traceability, and fraud detection capabilities. The project was developed as part of a course on blockchain technology.


## Motivation
The Indian agricultural sector faces various challenges, including fragmented supply chains, inadequate cold chain infrastructure, poor packaging, inefficient traders, and a lack of organized logistics, resulting in inefficiencies and losses. These challenges, along with the absence of technology and a manual labor system, lead to an increase in lead time and costs for importing goods. Furthermore, the lack of compliance and traceability in traditional buying routes causes a growing lack of trust in the sourcing of produce sold in markets. This project's motivation is to explore the potential of blockchain technology in the agricultural sector to improve traceability, sustainability, and transparency while streamlining cooperative operations, benefiting both farmers and consumers.


## Abstract
The food supply chain has a number of challenges, including a lack of transparency and disengagement among stakeholders. By providing a transparent and traceable digital ledger of transactions and movements for all supply chain actors, blockchain technology can provide a resolution to these problems. We propose a blockchain-based system for tracking a product's full path, from its raw components to the finished item in the store. Many advantages of the offered system include improved
quality assessment, increased product transparency and traceability, and sophisticated fraud detection capabilities. By reinventing the way transactions are carried out and enabling stakeholders to obtain a complete record of each product's journey, the system has the potential to completely alter the food supply chain. Also, by minimising inefficiencies, waste, and fraudulent activities that have a negative influence on the supply chain, the deployment of this system can remove limits imposed by the current supply chain. Overall, the suggested blockchain-based system has the potential to significantly increase the efficiency, transparency, and traceability of the food supply chain.
